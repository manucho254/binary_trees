#### 0x1D. C - Binary trees

- In the set of projects we take a look at how binary trees work, and
  implement a binary tree using C.

Thing to learn:
  - What is a binary tree
  - What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
  - What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
  - What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
  - What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
  - What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
